## 📡 Working Principle
1. **OpenCV** captures the face from the webcam and calculates head position.
2. **Python** processes these positions and sends serial data to Arduino.
3. **Arduino UNO** receives data and controls two servo motors accordingly.
4. The **servo motors** move the artificial eyes inside the skull to mimic real eye movement.

## 🔍 Future Enhancements
- Integrate **deep learning models** for improved facial tracking.
- Add **wireless communication** (e.g., Wi-Fi or Bluetooth).
- Use **ESP32-CAM** for a compact wireless version.
- Sync movement with additional facial expressions or speech.
